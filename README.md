## About question 2

You can find two forms in /two
For the mock data form, you may enter any value
For mock address input:
It is not necessary to enter a real address; it can be 0x0, 0, 1, or even a . (dot)
After entering the address, you may select a token and enter a value, then press the [Add] button to add the token to your balance.
Delay input is optional, but if you want to see the effect of the loading state, you may add it in "seconds".

For the swap token form:
Just a normal swap token form :D

For the backend part:
You may refer to this, but it is just a simple backend, no auth and http cookie. Nothing important.

I have added some mock data to display the answer. You can see the display at /three.
